Tempus Coding Challenge

**The challenge:** Prototype a variant interpretation tool to label the following.
1. Depth of sequence coverage at the site of variation.
2. Number of reads supporting the variant.
3. Percentage of reads supporting the variant versus those supporting reference reads.
4. Using the VEP hgvs API, get the:
  + gene of the variant
  + type of variation (substitution, insertion, CNV, etc.)
  + variant effect (missense, silent, intergenic, etc.)
5. The minor allele frequency of the variant if available.
